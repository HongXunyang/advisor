Welcome to the documentation for the Ad-VISOR, a PyQt5-based app for X-ray scattering/diffraction prep. Use the sections below to install the app, understand the UI flow, and learn how to extend it.

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) — install and run in two minutes.
- [Using the App](using_the_app.md) — guided tour of the init window and feature tabs.
- [Data & Outputs](data_and_formats.md) — CIF inputs, session ideas, and exports.
- [Extending the App](extending.md) — add features with the domain–controller–view pattern.
- [Project Notes](project_notes.md) — structure, design choices, and placeholders for visuals.

> Tip: This doc set is intentionally readable without deep math or PyQt internals. See `docs/feature_development.md` for a developer checklist.
